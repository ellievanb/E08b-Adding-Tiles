# E08b-Adding-Tiles

We were instructed to create a basic paddle and ball game similar to pong. The goal of the game is to use the paddle to bounce the ball and collect all of the different tiles. If the ball falls below the paddle and off the screen, the attempt has failed and a message that says "Died" will appear on the screen. Good luck!
